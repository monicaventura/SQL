#In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data.

# 1. How many orders were placed in January?
SELECT COUNT(orderID) as Count
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE LENGTH(orderID)=6;

#2. How many of those orders were for an iPhone?
SELECT COUNT(*) as Count
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales 
WHERE LENGTH(orderID)=6
AND Product LIKE "%iPhone%";

3. Select the customer account numbers for all the orders that were placed in February.
SELECT DISTINCT acctnum as CustomerAccounts
FROM BIT_DB.customers as c
JOIN BIT_DB.FebSales as f
ON c.order_id = f.orderID
WHERE LENGTH(OrderId)=6;

4. Which product was the cheapest one sold in January, and what was the price?
SELECT DISTINCT product as Product, price as Price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE price IN (SELECT MIN(price) FROM BIT_DB.JanSales);

OR 

SELECT DISTINCT product as Product, price as Price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE LENGTH(orderID)=6
ORDER BY price Limit 1;

5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT ROUND(SUM(quantity)* price,2) as Revenue, product as Product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE LENGTH(orderID)=6
GROUP BY product;


6. Which products were sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, how many of each were sold, and what was the total revenue?
SELECT Product as Product, SUM(quantity) as Count, SUM(quantity) * price as Revenue FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE LENGTH(orderID)=6
AND location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101";

7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(DISTINCT c.acctnum) as Count, ROUND(AVG(quantity*price),2) as AvgSpent from BIT_DB.FebSales as f
JOIN BIT_DB.customers as c
ON c.order_id = f.orderID
WHERE quantity > 2
AND LENGTH(orderID)=6;

8. List all the products sold in Los Angeles in February, and include how many of each were sold
SELECT product as Product, sum(quantity) as Count, location as Location
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE LENGTH(orderID)=6
AND location LIKE "%Los Angeles%"
