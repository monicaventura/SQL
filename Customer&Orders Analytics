ORDER BY price Limit 1;

5. What is the total revenue for each product sold in January?
SELECT ROUND(SUM(quantity)* price,2) as Revenue, product as Product
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE LENGTH(orderID)=6
GROUP BY product;

7. How many customers ordered more than 2 products at a time in February, and what was the average amount spent for those customers?
SELECT count(DISTINCT c.acctnum) as Count, ROUND(AVG(quantity*price),2) as AvgSpent from BIT_DB.FebSales as f

ON c.order_id = f.orderID
WHERE quantity > 2
AND LENGTH(orderID)=6;

SELECT SUM(quantity), COUNT(distinct acctnum), SUM(quantity)/COUNT(distinct acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
JOIN BIT_DB.customers
on BIT_DB.FebSales.orderID = BIT_DB.customers.order_id
WHERE LENGTH(orderID)=6;

13. Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?
SELECT product, ROUND(SUM(quantity * price),2) as Revenue
